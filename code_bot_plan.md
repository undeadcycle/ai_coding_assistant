Given your preferences and resources, here's a more detailed plan to set up your local AI coding assistant bot:

### 1. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Features**:
  - Code generation
  - Code completion
  - Code review and optimization
  - Debugging assistance
  - Documentation generation
  - Answering coding-related questions

### 2. Supported Languages

- **Primary Languages**:
  - Python
  - Bash

### 3. User Interface

- **GUI Chatbot**:
  - Use Tkinter for a simple GUI interface.
  - Text input for interaction.

### 4. AI Models

- **Pre-trained Models**:
  - Mistral
  - CodeLlama
  - Ensure the models can run on your local machine (Intel i7-12700KF, 32GB RAM, RTX 4060 8GB).

### 5. Data and Models

- **Data Requirements**:
  - Source code repositories for training fine-tuning.
  - Documentation and Q&A datasets.
  - Explore open-source datasets available for Python and Bash coding assistance.

### 6. Integration and Environment

- **Development Environment**:
  - Local machine deployment.
  - Consider using virtual environments for dependency management.

- **Dependencies**:
  - Tkinter for GUI.
  - Model libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch).
  - Other libraries as required by the chosen models.

### 7. Security and Privacy

- **User Authentication**:
  - Implement simple user authentication (e.g., password-based).

### 8. Performance and Scalability

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Aim for reasonable response times.
  - Retain information from the current chat session.

### 9. Maintenance and Updates

- **Maintenance Plan**:
  - Regularly update models and dependencies.
  - Address bugs and add new features as needed.

### 10. User Feedback and Improvement

- **Feedback Mechanism**:
  - Log interactions and errors for analysis.
  - Implement a simple feedback form within the GUI.

### 11. Budget and Resources

- **Resources**:
  - User's time for development and maintenance.
  - Primary computer (Intel i7-12700KF, 32GB RAM, RTX 4060 8GB).
  - Secondary computer (Xeon 2690 v3, 24GB RAM, GTX 1050 Ti) for offloading tasks if needed.

### 12. Timeline

- **Development Timeline**:
  - Establish a rough timeline based on your availability and complexity of the project.
  - Set milestones for key features (e.g., basic chatbot GUI, model integration, code generation).

### Implementation Plan

1. **Setup Development Environment**:
   - Install Python, Tkinter, and necessary libraries.
   - Create virtual environments for dependency management.

2. **Build GUI**:
   - Design and implement the Tkinter-based GUI.
   - Add text input and display areas for interaction.

3. **Integrate AI Models**:
   - Choose appropriate pre-trained models (Mistral, CodeLlama).
   - Load and run models locally.
   - Implement code generation and completion functionalities.

4. **Develop Core Features**:
   - Add functionalities like code review, debugging assistance, and documentation generation.
   - Ensure these features work seamlessly within the GUI.

5. **Implement Security**:
   - Add user authentication to secure the bot.

6. **Test and Iterate**:
   - Test the bot thoroughly.
   - Gather feedback and make necessary improvements.

7. **Maintenance and Updates**:
   - Plan for regular updates and maintenance based on your usage and feedback.

# TODO: 

1. finish .desktop file

2. create installer to cleanly place files in correct place? .deb? prompt for model weights location?

3. have conda_env.sh write CLONE_PATH variable to path.env

4. 
  1. I think hugginface token is not being used? add it back in for robustness with other models? remove it?
  2. i dont think i need the hugginface repo at all anymore since using the model straight from meta?

5. do i need these prerequisites to run codellama? torch, fairscale, fire, sentencepiece

6. compare to https://github.com/meta-llama/codellama/blob/main/example_completion.py and https://github.com/meta-llama/codellama/blob/main/example_instructions.py

7. do i need to add more to my gitignore file? https://github.com/meta-llama/codellama/blob/main/.gitignore
